                Black jack is a  game that a players compete against the a dealer rather than each other. 
                The main goal is to get  hand  with cards having totalvalues 21 without passing 21 (busting).
                When it begins , the players and the dealer receive two cards each. 
                The players' cards are always face up, while the dealer has one facing down  and other one face up. 
                The best possible Blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace with any ten-point card.
